            <h2>Who is a <b id="MetaGroupHeading">Meta Group</b> Member?</h2>
            <p>
                We are a group of volunteers who are here to create something special. <br>
                Everything nowdays is plus, premium, pay money stuff and we don't like that. That's why we have created Meta. <br>
                This is a passionate project, while we are developing Meta, we are learning how to code a bot, how to code a website, how to deal with customers <br>
                how to come over difficulties, how to find solutions and how to implemete new ideas and make them better. There is so much to learn!! <br><br>
                We, the Meta Group, are here to make your Discord server premium, we hate ads, we like when things are clean, beautiful, stable and simple to use. If this is something you also like, use Meta. <br><br>
                Don't be ashamed to reach out to any of us, while you're asking for help, we're also improving our skills, it's a win-win. The Meta Group is one of the friendliest team i have managed within my 5 years of experience. <br><br>
                To join us, you'll need to be noticed, we reach out to people who we think will fit our team. The best place for it would be the Support server ;) <br><br>
                Happy Protecting - The Head Of Meta Group @goodguyfrosty

                      Dankly has lots of experience when it comes to managing in Discord. He is a volunteer, who keeps the Meta volunteer team running. <br>
                      Dankly loves to be behind the scenes, you almost never see him in public channels or communicate, because all is happening behind the screnes :o <br>  
                      But... he keeps an eye out. If you say something, it's very likely that Dankly has seen it.

                      Bapo... bapo the taco.. no he actually is not a taco.. but.. anyways. <br>
                      Bapo is the bonker in Meta. If you mess up, you have to deal with him. He makes the final decicions when it comes to Moderation. <br>
                      If you ever want to become a moderator, it's very likely, that Bapo is the one whose dealing with you. It could be fun... or...... you never know. <br>
