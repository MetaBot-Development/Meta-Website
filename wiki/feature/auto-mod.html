          <h2>What is Auto Mod and why we offer it</h2>
          <p>
            Auto Mod is short for Auto Moderation. Meta will take care of the most common Moderation tasks. <br>
            We offer 4 different Auto Mod rules and they are all enabled, once the Auto Mod module is enabled. You cannot enable or disable the rules individually. <br><br>

            Since Discord has started to provide their own Auto Mod, a lot of the systems are quite useless when it comes to auto moderation in bots. But there is a catch. <br>
            Meta makes you click 1 button, to enable 4 rules that all server should have enbled. Discord system is becoming more and more difficult and harder to understand as the time goes on, that's why we created our module. <br>
            If you want to make your server fancy and very protected and restricted, you can use Discord's automod, but Meta allows you to make the server safe and free, by clicking 1 button. Learn about the rules below.

        <h2>No Racism</h2>
